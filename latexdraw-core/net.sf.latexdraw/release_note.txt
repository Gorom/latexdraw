Version 3.1.0
- When zooming using the mouse, the zoom process follows the pointer.
  The zoom increment, min, and max values have been changed to fit this new feature.
- Like many drawing applications, the view point of the drawing area can be move using
  the middle button of the mouse (or both the right and left buttons in some cases).
  It is more convenient than using the scroll bars.
