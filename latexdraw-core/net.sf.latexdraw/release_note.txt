Version 3.3.6

- fixed: the tooltip that shows LaTeX compilation errors while putting the cursor over a text shape may freeze the application.
 Moreover, the displayed message was not correct.
- fixed: problem of encoding (MS950) not supported by the XML serialiser that prevented SVG files to be saved.
- fixed: arcs were not correctly drawn and saved as SVG on certain start/end angles.
- fixed: the installer cannot be run on some configurations (e.g. Fedora 25 with Wayland).
- fixed: the shape deletion is not re-activated when clicking the PST tab and the clicking the drawing tab back.

- improvement: better feedback on compilation errors during exports as PDF/PS documents.
