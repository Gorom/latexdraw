<h4>LaTeXDraw</h4>
			<p>
<b>LaTeXDraw</b> is a graphical drawing editor for LaTeX. LaTeXDraw can be used to 1) generate <a href="http://tug.org/PSTricks/main.cgi/"><b>PSTricks</b></a> code; 2) directly create PDF or PS pictures. LaTeXDraw is developped in Java and thus runs on top of Linux, Windows, and Mac OS X. LaTeXDraw is developed in Java and thus runs on top of Linux, Windows, and Mac OS X. You need <a href="http://java.sun.com/javase/downloads/index.jsp">Java 1.7</a> to launch LaTeXDraw.

	  <div class="entry">
<p>
This new version fixes major bugs. I did not have the time to finish the support of PSPlot functions. It will be part of the next release for sure.
Amongst the fixed bugs, the biggest one is certainly a bug related to the PDF/PS export on Windows 8.1.
Give an eye to the <a href="https://launchpad.net/latexdraw/3.x/3.2">release note</a> for more details.

	  <div class="entry">
<p>
This new version brings important changes and fixes major bugs. The new features are: 
<ul>
<li>Opacity and strokeopacity attributes are now supported. That permits to set the opacity of colours for the line border and the filling.</li>
<li>The size of drawing area is no more limited to the size of the drawing. Additional boundaries are now provided around the drawing area to ease the editing.</li>
<li> In complement to the previous change, a page (US letter only for the moment) is painted.</li>
<li> When zooming using the mouse, the zoom process follows the pointer. The zoom increment, min, and max values have been changed to fit this new feature.</li>
<li> Like many drawing applications, the view point of the drawing area can be move using the middle button of the mouse (or both the right and left buttons in some cases). It is more convenient than using the scroll bars.</li>
<li> Better rendering performance.</li>
<li> Ukrainian translation added.</li>
<li> A menu item has been added to go to the latexdraw manual</li>
<li> A text field that contains the LaTeX compilation error log has been added to the text toolbar.</li>
</ul>
Regarding the fixed bugs, the major one is the non-creation of LaTeX text on Windows 7 and 8.<br/>

	  <div class="entry">
<p>
If the native LaTeX rendering works like a charm on Linux, it seems that it does not work correctly on Windows.
I just fixed an issue that blocked that feature on Windows Seven but I do not have a Windows 8 to test that.
So, do not hesitate to <a href="https://ci.inria.fr/malai/job/latexdraw/lastBuild/net.sf.latexdraw$latexdraw.core/">download the latest devolopment version</a> to test the LaTeX rendering on Windows (Seven, 8) and MacOSX, and send me an email or use the forum to give me feedback!

It is about time. Latexdraw 3.0 has been released today. More than 3 years without any stable release.
As I said previously Latexdraw has been totally rewritten to be more usable and easy to maintain in the future.

Ok ok folks. Almost one year without any release... If you want to blame someone, blame Blizzard to have released <a href="http://eu.battle.net/d3/">Diablo III</a> in April 2012 and my job ^^. More seriously this release re-introduces the conversion of pstricks code into shapes, and fixes several and annoying bugs such as the pdf-blank-page bug. Just as a reminder, this branch 3.0 is almost a complete rewriting of the application to ease the future developments. That's why it takes so long. The version 3.0 is almost feature complete. So the next release will be a beta one and will bring bug fixes, performance and usability improvements.

Fourth alpha just released. Still for testing purposes only. This version: several Windows Seven bugs fixed; can customise grids and free hand shapes using widgets; can change the angles of arcs using their handlers; can reuse and create templates; the PSTricks parameter 'showpoints' supported for BÃ©zier curves. Test it!<br/> One more alpha version is expected to (re-)support PSTricks import. Then, beta versions will be prepared to fix issues.

Third alpha just released. Still for testing purposes only. I was pretty busy these last weeks so that this release does not contain a lot of improvements: can rotate shapes; can customise axes; can customise the drawings' properties. Another alpha is expected in a couple of weeks.

Whooooooooooo! Finally a release. It's about time. Ok ok, <b>this is not a stable release but a preview for testing purposes only</b>. LaTeXDraw 3.0.0 alpha 1 has been released with a lot of improvements such a native support of LaTeX text, pdf export on Macos has been fixed, etc.<br />You can get the files and the release note there: <a href="https://sourceforge.net/projects/latexdraw/files/beta%20testing/3.0.0%20alpha1/">Download alpha 1</a>.<br />There is still a lot of features not yet re-introduced in 3.0.0 (for your memory: LaTeXDraw has been completely rewritten for the 3.0.0 version), such as: it is not possible to rotate shapes yet; no PSTricks import; no recent files; some widgets are still missing for modifying some shapes' attributes; etc.<br />You can report any problem <a href="https://launchpad.net/latexdraw">there</a> or <a href="http://sourceforge.net/tracker/?group_id=156523&atid=800126">there</a>.<br />I will release a new alpha version at the end of February.<br />

	  <div class="entry">
<p>
More than one year without any release and post... Shame on me. LaTeXDraw 3.0 in on the road and a first beta should be released before the end of this year. This release takes a lot of time because I am completely rewritting LaTeXDraw: the code of 2.0 is really awful and I wanted to integrate the results of my PhD into LaTeXDraw in order to improve this last.<br/>
The most important feature of LaTeXDraw 3.0 will be the native support of LaTeX text. It means that you will be able to write LaTeX text as in your favourite LaTeX editor. The text will be rendered in LaTeXDraw as in your final pdf or ps document. For example, in the following screen-shot I added a text in the drawing and typed a formula.<br />
<center><a href="./images/addingText.png"><img src="./images/addingText.png" height="390" width="800"/></a></center>
Once typed, the text is compiled in LaTeX to be rendered in LaTeXDraw:
<center><a href="./images/textAdded.png"><img src="./images/textAdded.png" height="390" width="800"/></a></center>
This idea is strongly inspired by Lyx ;). Of course, if you want to use LaTeX commands coming from various packages, you can add \usepackage{} commands as it is already possible in LaTeXDraw 2.0.<br />
You can also discover in the screen-shots others new features; but I will speak about them in next posts soon.
