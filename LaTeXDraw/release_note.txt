Version 3.0 beta 1

Added:
- new localisations: Brazilian Portuguese, Hungarian, Japanese, Turkish, Vietnamese

Improvements:
- Native support of LaTeX texts: texts added to drawings are compiled in pdf using latex and then imported in the drawing.
- Can add/modify texts directly into the drawing using an integrated text field (no more dialogue box).
- no more dialogue boxes to change shapes properties. They can be changed using the toolbar which has been widely improved.
- when selecting a kind of shape, the corresponding widgets dedicated to the selected kind of shape are displayed to customise shapes.
- users can abort the creation of shapes using the escape key
- the graphical library has been totally rewritten:
   - better shapes movement
   - less memory consumption
   - can change the roundness of the corners of a rectangle/square using a handler
   - arcs are ellipse-based instead of circle-based
   - the text is now compiled in LaTeX and imported
   - no more button to create a line; you can create a line using the button 'joined lines'
   - better use of handlers to resize and rotate shapes
- the undo/redo manager has been totally rewritten:
   - less memory consumption
   - more stable and efficient
   - more actions can be undone
   - more information about the undoable actions (the undo/redo messages are more precise)
- the error manager has been totally rewritten:
   - the manager can be accessed by the menu 'help' -> 'Error console'
   - the error window displays all the errors, not a single one
- the widgets of the bottom tool bar now appear and disappear more accurately
- the selected shapes are no more unselected when selecting the pencil.
- can undo/redo change of unit (cm or inch).

Changes:
- the PPC (point per centimetre) cannot be changed anymore.
- the PPM export is no more supported
- the basic EPS export is no more supported (the LaTeX EPS export is still supported).
- the change of unit (cm or inch) can be now performed throw menu items in the "Drawing" menu.
- the ldp format, that was the default format for 1.9.* and older versions, is no more supported. 
- no more button 'default' in the properties panel since we think there are useless.
- the type of magnetic grid can be changed using the grid toolbar.
- the magnetic grid cannot be magnetic when it is not visible.
