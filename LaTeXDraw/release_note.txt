Version 3.0 beta 1

Added:
- Native support of LaTeX texts: texts added to drawings are compiled in pdf using latex and then imported in the drawing.
- Can place texts at different positions: bottom-left, bottom-middle, top-right, etc. This feature produces PSTricks code based on the rput command.
- new localisations: Brazilian Portuguese, Hungarian, Japanese, Turkish, Vietnamese, Serbian.
- double borders supported for arcs.
- a handler to set the rounded corner of rectangles.
- A system tab in the "About LaTeXDraw" dialogue box to give some information about the system.

Improvements:
- Can add/modify texts directly into the drawing using an integrated text field (no more dialogue box).

- the undo/redo manager has been totally rewritten:
