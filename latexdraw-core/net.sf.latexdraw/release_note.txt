************************************************************
Version 3.3.4

Improvements:
- Instead of double-clicking on a text shape to change the text, you can use the F2 key (the text shape must be selected).
- Can click on the canvas to change text (before, you had to press 'enter')
- Can import cubic Bézier paths (as Bézier curves). The second control point, however, always equals the first one.
- A log is now created during the installation.

Bugs fixed:
 - The preferences were not stored correctly on MacOSX El Capitan
 - The look&feel was not correctly loaded on MacOSX El Capitan
 - The backspace key can now be used to remove a shape, fixing the deletion problem on MacOSX El Capitan
 - The use of the Fn key on Mac El Capitan blocked many keyboard shortcuts
 - SVG Paths that start with a relative element are not correctly imported
